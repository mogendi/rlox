# rlox
An (incorrect) implementation of bob nystroms clox: https://craftinginterpreters.com/

This is more of an exploration of rust features than it is a langugae implementation, there is "correctness" for tiny toy programs but beyond 
that all bets are off (stack manipulations are broken).
All features are present for this except the GC and optimizations.
